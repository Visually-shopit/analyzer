Once deployed, you're able to query the service by including a header value of 'url', which indicates the url of the website that you want to "understand/comprehend". The Lambda function parses the website represented by the url and runs the body of this website through the Amazon Comprehend service.

We analyze the tags of the extracted images and do analysis of the most search tags.
